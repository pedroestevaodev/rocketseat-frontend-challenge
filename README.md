This project is a solution to a frontend technical challenge by **Rocketseat**, focused on building a simple e-commerce application with product listing, filters, pagination, and a persistent shopping cart. Developed with **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Styled Components**, the project demonstrates best practices in state management, GraphQL API consumption, and user experience.
